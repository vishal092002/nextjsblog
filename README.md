# NextJS Tutorial

# Assignment Brief: Understanding React & Introduction to NextJS

## Instructor Video Overview - [Here](https://youtu.be/Jg2v8MsqjOc)

**Objective:** This assignment aims to acquaint you with React and NextJS, two integral tools used in modern web development.

## Part I - React

Begin by gaining a deeper understanding of React, its origins, and its purpose. A comprehensive documentary on the creation of React at Facebook has been made available to provide you valuable insights into React's inner workings and philosophy. This documentary is not just informative, but is also crucial to building your foundation in React.

## Part II - NextJS

Moving on, familiarize yourself with NextJS. Despite being based on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, NextJS is a powerful framework that has earned its place among the most popular and potent web application frameworks globally. Also known as server-side React, NextJS is an excellent stepping stone into the world of React. Don't let this intimidate you; instead, embrace the opportunity to explore its capabilities.

## Part III - Practice

After developing a conceptual understanding of React and NextJS, apply what you've learned in a practical exercise. For this part, you are required to complete a series of text-based tutorials. These tutorials will guide you through the steps to get a great handle on NextJS and the very basisc of React.  

You need to complete these tutorials outside of this project because they will instruct you to clone a new starting repository for each tutorial.  Once you complete the final tutorial put the code in the files that I have provided for you in this project and when you have successfully done this, run the Playwright tests and when they all pass submit to GitHub and enable the GitHub Pages Action.  I took the code out of the files in this project, but left the folders and files you need to add the code to.   You will have to add all of the code from the final project except for the package.json file, if you change this it will break the project grading.

**Complete The following Tutorials - They don't take long (10-20 minutes each on average):**

- https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app
- https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/navigate-between-pages
- https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/assets-metadata-css
- https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/data-fetching
- https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/dynamic-routes
- https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/api-routes
- https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/deploying-nextjs-app

# Submision Guidelines

Complete through deploying your NextJS app to GitHub Pages, its better than GitHub Pages.  

Put a link to your site hosted on GitHHub pages [here](#)

Submit a link to your repository to Canvas when your code passes the Playwright tests.



# Install Instructions:

npm install
npx playwright install
npm run dev <- Starts the development server

How to run tests from another terminal window:
npm run test
